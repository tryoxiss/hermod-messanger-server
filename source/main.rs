    // - [ ] Route Traffic
    // - [ ] Store ENCRYPTED data
    // - [ ] Cache information for zero-trust architecure.
    //      - [ ] This protocol, and this implementation, are built with the
    //        assumpstions that:
    //      - [ ] The only instance that can be trusted is that the user chose, and
    //        any other instance is unsafe and possibly malicuous.

    // protocol. This is considered acceptable, as long as it maintains the same
    // zero-trust arcitecture, and can only be accessed by authorised parties.
