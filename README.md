# bonfire-server

An implementation of our down DIstributed Instant Messaging (DIM) protocol in Rust. It is built in full complaince with the spec and is intended to be as easy to install and configure as possible and be able to be run on anything from a Rasberry Pi to a indistry grade server. 

> **Warning**
> This software is not currently suitable for any productin builds and is not spec-compliant as it is in very early developement.
