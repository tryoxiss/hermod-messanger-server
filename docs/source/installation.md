# Installation

Chances are you either to do one (or both!) of two things: 

- Install Hermod on a server of your own
- Help develop Hermod

And chacnes are if its the first you don't have much patience and we get it, so lets go over that now. 

## Installing on a server of your own

1. We have no production relases
2. We will add instructions when we do. 
3. Its really much just running `INSTALL.sh` with `sudo` though.

## Setting up a dev server for testing

1. We don't have this yet
2. Please help
